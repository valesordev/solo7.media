# <Imprint> — illustration system

**Status:** draft | AD v<n> — approved <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Direction:** <the direction statement, from brand/foundation.md>
**Basis:** visual-audit.md @ <short commit>
**ChatGPT project:** <Imprint> — Art

## Subject matter
What appears in this imprint's images, and what never does (people, faces, vehicles, UI…).

## Rendering
One approach, in plain visual terms (flat shapes, line and hatch, matte volumes…).
Why the generator repeats it reliably.

## Value and colour
How the image relates to the tokens: ink-only (painted with a token at runtime), duotone mapped
to two tokens, or a limited palette that treatment quantizes to token values. Which theme(s).

## Line
Weight, character, hierarchy. "None" is an answer.

## Light
Direction, hardness, time of day. Default and allowed exceptions.

## Composition
Horizon and scale cues, negative space, crop survival. Rules that hold for every composition type.

## Composition types
| Type | Aspect | Empty zone | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| hero-wide | 2.4:1 | <e.g. left third for type> | site headers |
| banner-wide | <e.g. 4:1> | <…> | README and social banners |
| square-specimen | 1:1 | <…> | project cards, avatars |
| vertical-plate | <e.g. 2:3> | <…> | posters, document covers |

A slot names exactly one type. A new type is a revision of this file.

## Treatment
The script under `brands/_tools/treat/` every image goes through, with its default parameters, and
what it does (threshold to ink on alpha, recolour to tokens, posterize, grain removal).

## Exclusions
Always: no text, lettering, logos, watermarks, UI, named artists or franchises, real people.
Imprint-specific: <the sibling imprints' languages this one must not borrow>.

Rules here hold for every image. Anything about one composition (this tree, this moon) goes in that
slot's prompt, never here.

## Changelog
- AD v<n> <date> — <what changed>, because <why>; evidence: <slot or image>.
