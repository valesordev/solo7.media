# Prompt rules

The imprint's ChatGPT project instructions carry the illustration system. A prompt carries only what's specific
to the slot and the candidate.

Each block, in this order:

1. **Request line:** `<slot> · candidate <letter> · AD v<n>`. Brian matches files to candidates by it.
2. **Format:** the composition type, with its aspect ratio and orientation, from the spec (the generator picks the pixels; treatment
   and the build resize). State where the empty zone is: "keep the left third nearly empty".
3. **Subject:** what's in the image, concrete nouns first, then position and scale.
4. **Thesis:** the candidate's one-line variation, in visual terms.
5. **Keep:** when reference files are attached, name each and the features to keep consistent with it.
6. **Not:** at most three slot-specific exclusions. The project instructions already hold the general ones.

Write for the treatment. If the treatment thresholds to ink, ask for clean black line on a plain light
ground with no tone washes. If it maps to two tokens, ask for two flat values. The easier the
treatment's job, the less the result looks generated.

**Mark sheets** (kind `mark`): ask for a sheet of 9–12 small variations on one axis, flat black on white,
no text, no 3D, no gradients, each mark in its own cell. Describe the construction (grid, the construction
angle from the foundation, stroke contrast) instead of a style. The selected cell gets rebuilt
as geometry (`marks.md`), so precision doesn't matter here. Proportion and idea do.

Block format:
